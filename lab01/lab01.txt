-- What are the types of data available to you?
I'm reviwing one of the MovieLens datasets (1M), that consists in 1 million of ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies.
In particular, the exact number of ratings acording to wc is 1000209.
I prefer to work with this kind of dataset instead of restricted API.

-- Provide an "interesting" record, explain its properties and why it is interesting
I think that "one" record cannot be interesting per se, it is necesary to analyze this in all its dimesions.
In fact, the dimensions that this particular data set is offering are really interesting, because the combination the dimensions of age, gender, and occupation could be useful for any movie reccomendation app.
One particular record that got my attention is the ratings of user 12: in general this user prefer genders like drama and thriller, but also one movie in the action/adventure cattegory appears: Raiders of the Lost Ark. In the other hand, Dick Tracy is in the bottom of the prefereces of user 12. This specific user seems to prefer drama/thriller movies, so is fascinationg to see how just one actiom movie at the top of his preferences. Probably this kind of information could be considered as a outlier, But findind the movies that are universally trough the users categories could be useful.

-- What are 3 questions you could answer using your data?
Which movies have top ratings for female users that work on sales and are under 35 years old?
How many drama movies the doctors under 45 years old see per year?
What gender/ocupation group under 65 years old prefers drama movies?
